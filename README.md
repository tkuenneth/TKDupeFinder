# Welcome

TKDupeFinder is a small tool to find duplicate files. Just enter the base directory and the app will search for files with the same [MD5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5) hash. These are considered the same. You can select versions, display and delete them. 

The app is more than ten years old, so portions of the source code may not be what you would expect today. It aged in a private repo, but recently I thought it might be useful for others, so I decided to make it available.

Currently I am building a new user interface using Jetpack Compose for Desktop. In doing so it might become easier to create native executables. I will update the README accordingly.
